## Useful Links

-   **Codesandbox** - Open ...

## Setup

### No-Setup Setup (recommended)

You should be able to go through the workshop in the browser, wich requires no setup. Go to this codesandbox and click `Fork` (in the top right corner).

### Local Setup

If you'd prefer to work through the workshop on your computer, follow the instructions on this section.
Please keep in mind the workshop time is very limited and if you have issues with this setup, you should opt by the Codesandbox alternative.

#### System Requirements

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) v2 or greater
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v10 or greater
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) v6 or greater

To verify if these are properly set up, run the following commands:

```
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

#### Clone project

If all the above requirements are met, run the following commands to clone and start the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/memsql/sinfo-workshop.git
cd sinfo-workshop
npm start
```

Note: If you want to commit and push your work as you go, fork first and then clone your fork instead of cloning this repo directly.
